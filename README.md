# Tiny Server

This is a simple test server that listens for HTTP requests and logs the request data to the console.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `brew install node` to install Node.js on your machine
3. Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install the project dependencies
4. Run `node index.js` to start the server
5. send POST requests to `http://localhost:3000` with a JSON body to see the server log the request data
